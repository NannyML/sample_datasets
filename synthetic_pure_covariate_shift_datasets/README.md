# Synthetic Pure Covariate Shift Datasets

The datasets in this folder have been created to test development of custom metrics for the NannyML cloud product.
The concept, meaning the underlying mapping between the targets and the model inputs $P(Y|X)$ remains the same but there is
covariate shift, which causes performance changes for the model in the dataset.

There are three datasets provided, a binary classification one, a multilcass classification one and a regression one.
